# Getting Started

Welcome to your new project.

It contains these folders and files, following our recommended project layout:

File or Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`app/` | content for UI frontends goes here
`db/` | your domain models and data go here
`srv/` | your service models and code go here
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration
`readme.md` | this getting started guide


## Next Steps

- Open a new terminal and run `npm i` and then `cds watch`.
- Add a database by run `cds deploy`, to watch the database in sql query, run `cds compile db/schema.cds -2 sql`
- (in VS Code simply choose _**Terminal** > Run Task > cds watch_)
- Start adding content, for example, a [db/schema.cds](db/schema.cds).
